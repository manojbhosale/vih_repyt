  $stats->add_data(1,10,2,0,1,4,5,1,10,8,7);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides basic functions used in descriptive statistics.
It borrows very heavily from Statistics::Descriptive::Full
(which is included with Statistics::Descriptive) with one major
difference.  This module is optimized for discretized data 
e.g. data from an A/D conversion that 
has a discrete set of possible values.  E.g. if your data is produced
by an 8 bit A/D then you'd have only 256 possible values in your data 
set.  Even though you might have a million data points, you'd only have
256 different values in those million points.  Instead of storing the 
entire data set as Statistics::Descriptive does, this module only stores
the values it's seen and the number of times it's seen each value.

For very large data sets, this storage method results in significant speed
and memory improvements.  In a test case with 2.6 million data points from
a real world application, Statistics::Descriptive::Discrete took 40 seconds 
to calculate a set of statistics instead of the 561 seconds required by
Statistics::Descriptive::Full.  It also required only 4MB of RAM instead of 
the 400MB used by Statistics::Descriptive::Full for the same data set.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item $stat = Statistics::Descriptive::Discrete->new();

Create a new statistics object.

=item $stat->add_data(1,2,3,4,5);

Adds data to the statistics object.  Sets a flag so that
the statistics will be recomputed the next time they're
needed.

=item $stat->add_data_tuple(1,2,42,3);

Adds data to the statistics object where every two elements
are a value and a count (how many times did the value occur?)
The above is equivalent to $stat->add_data(1,1,42,42,42);
Use this when your data is in a form isomorphic to 
($value, $occurrence).

=item $stat->max();

Returns the maximum value of the data set.

=item $stat->min();

Returns the minimum value of the data set.

=item $stat->count();

Returns the total number of elements in the data set.

=item $stat->uniq();

Returns the total number of unique elements in the data set.
For example, if your data set is (1,2,2,3,3,3), uniq will 
return 3.

=item $stat->sum();

Returns the sum of all the values in the data set.

=item $stat->mean();

Returns the mean of the data.

=item $stat->median();

Returns the median value of the data.

=item $stat->mode();

Returns the mode of the data.

=item $stat->variance();

Returns the variance of the data.

=item $stat->standard_deviation();

Returns the standard_deviation of the data.

=item $stat->sample_range();

Returns the sample range (max - min) of the data set.

=item $stat->get_data();

Returns a copy of the data array.  Note: This array could be
very large and would thus defeat the purpose of using this
module.  Make sure you really need it before using get_data().

=head1 NOTE

The interface for this module is almost identical to Statistics::Descriptive.  
This module is incomplete and not fully tested.  

=head1 BUGS

=over

=item *

Code for calculating mode is not as robust as it should be.

=item *

Other bugs are lurking I'm sure.

=back

=head1 TODO

=over 

=item *

Make test suite more robust

=item *

Add rest of methods (at least ones that don't depend on original order of data) 
from Statistics::Descriptive
